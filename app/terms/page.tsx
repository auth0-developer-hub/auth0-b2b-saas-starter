            <h3>Access to the Site</h3>
            <p>
              It is your responsibility to ensure your computer system meets all
              the necessary technical specifications to enable you to access and
              use the Site and is compatible with the Site. We may, from time to
              time, restrict access to certain features, parts or content of the
              Site to users who have registered with us (such as access to the
              Services support program features and pages). You must ensure that
              any registration details you provide are accurate. If you use or
              create a log-in ID (such as a username and password or other
              identifier) as part of our security procedures, you must treat
              such information as confidential and must not reveal it to anyone
              else. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your
              log-in ID and must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use
              or other security breach of which you become aware. We reserve the
              right to disable any log-in ID, at any time, if in our opinion you
              have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these terms of
              use or if any details you provide for the purposes of registering
              as a user prove to be false. We cannot guarantee the continuous,
              uninterrupted or error-free operability of the Site. There may be
              times when certain features, parts or content of the Site, or the
              entire Site, become unavailable (whether on a scheduled or
              unscheduled basis) or are modified, suspended or withdrawn by us,
              in our sole discretion, without notice to you. You agree that we
              will not be liable to you or to any third party for any
              unavailability, modification, suspension or withdrawal of the
              Site, or any features, parts or content of the Site.

              NOTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR MAKING CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
              IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIGITAL MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT (DMCA).
            </p>
            <p>
              Auth0, Inc. (Auth0) will respond to allegations of copyright
              violations in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
              (DMCA). The DMCA provides a process for a copyright owner to give
              notification to an online service provider concerning alleged
              copyright infringement. When a valid DMCA notification is
              received, the service provider responds under this process by
              taking down the offending content. On taking down content under
              the DMCA, we will take reasonable steps to contact the owner of
              the removed content so that a counter-notification may be filed.
              On receiving a valid counter-notification, we generally restore
              the content in question, unless we receive notice from the
              notification provider that a legal action has been filed seeking a
              court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in the
              infringing activity. Auth0 may provide copies of such notices to
              the participants in the dispute or to any other third parties, at
              our discretion and as required by law. Auth0&apos;s privacy policy
              does not protect information provided in these notices. NOTE: THE
              FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED EXCLUSIVELY FOR NOTIFYING AUTH0
              THAT YOUR COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL MAY HAVE BEEN INFRINGED. ALL OTHER
              INQUIRIES, SUCH AS REQUESTS FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, REPORTS OF
              EMAIL ABUSE, AND DATA PROTECTION OR PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS, WILL NOT
              RECEIVE A RESPONSE THROUGH THIS PROCESS.
