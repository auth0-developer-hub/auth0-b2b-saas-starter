                    <h2>II. Okta&apos;s Roles &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>
                      Okta is the controller of your Personal Data, as described
                      in this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise stated.&nbsp;
                      Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to the
                      extent that we process Personal Data in the role of a
                      processor (or a comparable role such as a “service
                      provider” in certain jurisdictions) on behalf of our
                      customers, including where we offer to our customers
                      various cloud products and services, through which our
                      customers (and/or their affiliates) connect their own
                      websites and applications to our hosted platform
                      (including our Auth0 by Okta-branded services), sell or
                      offer their own products and services, send electronic
                      communications to other individuals, or otherwise collect,
                      use, share or process Personal Data via our cloud products
                      and services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Each of our customers, not Okta, controls whether they
                      provide you with an account or other access to the Okta
                      identity cloud service through their subscription, and if
                      they provide you with such accounts or other access
                      through their subscription, they control what information
                      about you that they submit to our service. This content
                      may include contact information (such as your first and
                      last name, email address, and phone number), professional
                      information (such as the department you work for at your
                      place of employment), or other types of information that a
                      customer chooses to submit. Use of this content by Okta is
                      governed by agreements between Okta and the Customer.

                    <p>
                      For detailed privacy information applicable to situations
                      where an Okta customer (and/or a customer affiliate) who
                      uses Okta&apos;s cloud products and services is the
                      controller, please reach out to the respective customer
                      directly. We are not responsible for the privacy or data
                      security practices of our customers, which may differ from
                      those set forth in this Privacy Policy. If not stated
                      otherwise either in this Privacy Policy or in a separate
                      disclosure, we process such Personal Data in the role of a
                      processor or service provider on behalf of a customer
                      (and/or its affiliates), who is the responsible controller
                      of the applicable Personal Data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If your Personal Data has been submitted to us by or on
                      behalf of an Okta customer and you wish to exercise any
                      rights you may have under applicable data protection laws,
                      please inquire with the applicable customer directly.
                      Because we may only access a customer&apos;s data upon
                      instruction from that customer, if you wish to make your
                      request directly to us, please provide to us the name of
                      the Okta customer who submitted your Personal Data to us.
                      If we are able to verify the Okta customer, we will refer
                      your request to that customer and support them as needed
                      in responding to your request within a reasonable
                      timeframe.

                      considered Personal Data is our use of cookies. Cookies
                      are small text files that are placed on your web browser
                      and that help us recognize your browser or device as a

                      for market research, or other analytics or advertising
                      that is not tied to a specific individual. For example, we
                      may use Google Analytics to help us track how many
                      individuals visited our websites. We may also utilize

                      our marketing efforts and to reach potential customers
                      across the web. For example, we contract with third-party

                      A second common technology we use to collect metadata that
                      may be considered Personal Data is beacon technology. We

                      activity and help us to improve our business operations
                      and strategy, such as by understanding our email
                      communications&apos; functionality and improving our
                      websites and content. For example, if you click on a
                      marketing email we send to you about a new product or
                      service, the beacon will provide signals to us that you

                      VI. Okta&apos;s Security Posture &amp; Measures Taken
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                      Security is a critical priority for Okta. We maintain a
                      comprehensive, written information security program that
                      contains industry-standard administrative, technical, and
                      physical safeguards designed to prevent the loss or theft
                      and unauthorized access, use, disclosure or alteration of
                      Personal Data.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, no security system is perfect, and due to the
                      inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that
                      data, including Personal Data, is absolutely safe from
                      intrusion or other unauthorized access by others. You are
                      responsible for protecting your password(s) and other
                      authentication factors, as well as maintaining the
                      security of your devices.

                      If you use the Okta online service via a subscription

                      appropriately. Additional information about security

                    <p>
                      Your Personal Data may be collected, transferred to,
                      processed, and stored by us in the United States, and by
                      our affiliates, service providers, and third parties that
                      are based in other countries. The addresses of our offices
                      where Okta, Inc. and its affiliates are located can be
                      found online at

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Some of the countries where your Personal Data may be
                      processed, including the United States, are not subject to
                      an adequacy decision by the European Commission or your
                      local legislature and/or regulator, and may lack data
                      protection laws as comprehensive as or may not provide the
                      same level of data protection as your jurisdiction, such
                      as the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or
                      Japan. For example, as of the effective date of this
                      policy, the United States does not have a federal privacy
                      law that covers all types of data; however, privacy is
                      regulated by federal and state agencies and by various
                      state laws. In light of regional differences, Okta has put
                      in place various safeguards and the security measures
                      described above. For example, when we share Personal Data,
                      we take reasonable steps so that the recipient of your
                      Personal Data offers an adequate level of data protection,
                      for example, by entering into the appropriate agreements
                      containing relevant data protection provisions or we will
                      ask you for your prior consent to such international data
                      transfers.
